Banking Application

This is a one-stop solution to those business entities who use banking services on a day to day basis. With the introduction of banking apps people have now started using banking facilities much more than the traditional method of visiting the bank and getting the work done. Even people in remote areas have started opening bank accounts through banking applications. This application mainly focuses on operations like deposit, withdrawal, transfer money, etc. The users can withdraw or deposit money rather than going to the bank. The main purpose of this application is to store the bank data of a user and provide an interface for retrieving customer-related details with 100% accuracy. It allows the users to pay, transfer or withdraw money from one account to another account in seconds and it also allows access 24/7 to oneâ€™s account.
